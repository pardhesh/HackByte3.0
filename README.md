# Job Application Assistant - n8n Workflow
# Why We Built This
Job hunting in 2025 still feels like it’s stuck in 2010. Open 20 tabs, refresh job boards, copy-paste the same cold email, hope it lands somewhere other than a recruiter’s trash. It’s exhausting, repetitive, and wildly inefficient.

# Problem It Solves
If you're a job seeker, chances are you’ve:

1.Spent more time scrolling job boards than actually applying.

2.Played detective trying to find the elusive “Hiring Manager’s” email.

3.Fired off 20 generic cold emails and heard back from zero.

4.Lost track of where you applied, when, and to whom.

We figured: what if the job search could feel less like a full-time job?

# What This Project Actually Does
Just give us a one-line prompt like:

"Data Analyst in Bangalore"

"Backend Developer in Berlin"

"Marketing Manager, Remote"

And we’ll handle the rest—literally.

Scrapes jobs from platforms like LinkedIn, compiles them into a clean, deduplicated dataset (title, company, location, and
links).

Finds recruiter details, including names and email addresses (when available, and we're good at digging).

Generates AI-powered cold emails & personalized cover letters using your resume as context.

Automatically sends those emails to recruiters. No "Ctrl+V" needed.

Returns a single Google Sheet with every job, contact, and email status for easy tracking.

# What Makes It Awesome

One prompt, many jobs. No more juggling tabs or logging into 5 job sites.

AI does your talking. Personalized cold emails that don’t sound like they were written by a robot (even though, technically, they were).

Automated outreach. Recruiters get pinged without you lifting a finger.

Live job tracker. A Google Sheet with everything you need — no guesswork, no confusion.

# Who's It For?

Job seekers tired of the rinse-and-repeat application cycle.

Career switchers who need to hit volume fast.

Career coaches helping clients scale outreach without burnout.
